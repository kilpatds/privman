.SH NAME
priv_daemon - detach from the controlling terminal
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <privman.h>
.HP
.BI "int priv_daemon(int " nochdir ", int " noclose ");"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B priv_daemon
causes the process to detach from the controlling terminal, and run in the
background as system daemons.  A Privman managed program should call this
in place of calling the 
.B daemon
subroutine.

The arguments 
.IR nochdir " and " noclose
have the same meaning here as in the normal daemon method.  See 
.BR daemon (3)
for more details.

As a (hopefully) irrelevant detail, normally 
.B daemon
forks, and the child continues running while the original process
exits.  Since
.BR priv_init (3)
already forked, 
.B priv_daemon
causes the privilege server to detach from the controlling terminal
instead.

.SH FILES
.I @sysconfdir@/@PACKAGE@.d/ appname
.RS
The application's configuration file.  See 
.BR privman_conf (5)
for more details. 
.B priv_daemon
requires that the configuration allow the fork permission.
.RE
.SH BUGS
priv_fdreopen() has not yet been implemented, and might be needed to 
properly manage some of the cases.
