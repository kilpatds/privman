.TH PRIV_POPEN 3 "DECEMBER 2007" Unix "Subroutines"
.SH NAME
priv_popen, priv_pclose - process IO
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <privman.h>
.sp
.BI "FILE *priv_popen(const char *" command ", const char * " type ", const char *" user ",);"
.BI "int   priv_pclose(FILE *" stream ");"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.B
priv_popen()
function opens a process by creating a pipe, forking, and invoking the shell.
The 
.I type
argument may specify only reading or writing, not both.  The resulting stream
is correspondingly read-only or write-only.

The 
.I command
argument is a pointer to a null-terminated string containing a shell command
line.  The command is bassed to 
.I /bin/sh
using the -c flag; interpretation, if any, is performed by the shell.  The 
.I mode
argument is a pointer to a null-terminated string which must be either
`r' for reading or `w' for writing.

See the man page for
.BR popen(3)
for more details, as this method parallels popen(3).

The 
.B priv_pclose
function waits for the associated process to terminate, and returns
the exit status of the command as returned by 
.B wait4.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, a pointer to a valid stream is returned.  On error, NULL is
returned and 
.I errno
is set appropriately.

The 
.B priv_pclose
function returns -1 if
.B wait4
returns an error, or some other error is detected.
.SH ERRORS
See
.BR popen (3) 
and
.BR pclose (3) 
for more detail. In addition to the errors listed there,
.B priv_popen
may set
.I errno
to
.B EPERM
if the user is not listed in an ``run_as'' configuration directive, or if
the ``allow_as'' configuration primitive is not set to true.  See
.BR privman_conf (5)
for more details.
