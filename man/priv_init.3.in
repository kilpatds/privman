.SH NAME
priv_init - initialize the Privman library
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <privman.h>
.sp
.BI "void priv_init(const char *appname);"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B priv_init()
initializes the Privman libraries.
.B appname
is the name of the application.  A configuration file is expected at
.RB @sysconfdir@/@PACKAGE@.d/ appname
which describes the allowed privileged requests from the application.
The
.B appname
is also used for syslog messages and the like.

.B priv_init()
needs to be invoked with raised privilege (super-user rights).
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful return, the application resumes running as an unprivileged
user, normally "nobody'. Actually, the application has forked, and the
child process has returned from priv_init().

The process has changed directory into the root of the chroot jail specified
by the configuration file.  See 
.BR privman_conf (5)
for further details.


.SH FILES

See
