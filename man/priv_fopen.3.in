.SH NAME
priv_fopen - stream open functions for privileged files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <privman.h>
.sp
.BI "int priv_fopen(const char *" path ", const char *" mode ");"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B priv_fopen
opens the file whose name is the string pointed to by 
.I path
and associates a stream with it.  The stream can then be used by 
.BR fread ", " fwrite ", and other such function calls."
.B priv_fopen
takes the same mode strings as fopen(3).

.B priv_fopen
will only succeed if the configuration file for the application allows the
access.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.B priv_fopen
returns the new file stream, or NULL if an error occurred (in which case,
.I errno
is set appropriately).  See
.BR fopen (3)
for more details, as this method parallels it.
.SH FILES
.IR @sysconfdir@/@PACKAGE@.d/ appname
.RS
The application's configuration file.  See
.BR privman_conf (5)
for more details.
.RE
.SH BUGS
File creation may be possible without granting RW or AO access to the file.
