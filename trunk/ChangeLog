Version 0.9.3
	Changed the implimentation of priv_popen from being based on
	rerunas to its own primitive to get rid of the use of tempnam.

Version 0.9.2
	Added some micro benchmarks.
	msghdr didn't handle EINTR when reading.  Some changes in signal
	handling mean that it has to, so it does not.
	Clean up zombies if the first child exists on us after we switch
	over to the second.  Wrap wait4.
	Fixed a bug with pamStart if you didn't pass in a user it crashed.
	Changed priv_popen to a primitive, instead of building it on top
	of rerunas.  This allowed me to get rid of a call to tempnam.

Version 0.9.1
	Added a feature to add authenticated users to the runas list.  Add
	"auth_allow_rerun true" to your config file.
	Changed check_user to use it.
	Added code to myecho to test the extension framework, which also
	makes the test work on Solaris.
	Fixed CAP extensions.
	Don't allow "root" to match "*" in runas lists.
	Fixed test programs to not rely on certain accounts existing.
	Don't build check_user on Solaris.
	Fixed some man pages.

Version 0.9.0
	Added an extension framework, register_foo_fn and invoke_foo_fn
	where foo is one of "cap" (capability, returns file descriptor) or
	"info" (returns string)

	Added priv_popen_as(), priv_unlink(), and priv_wait4() methods.
	Changed how priv_rerunas works slightly.  Since the prototype
	to priv_rerunas() changed, the major number of the library has
	been bumped to 1.

	Better support of systems without PAM.  At least it ought to compile
	now.

Version 0.8.4:
	Support Solaris 9
	Add better autoconf tests to give us a shot at supporting other
	currently-untested platforms.

Version 0.8.3:
	Support Macintosh OS X
	Moved more/all debug output to syslog.
	Added man pages.
	Fixed a bug where privman.h might include files that didn't exist
	on the target system.
	If the "setuid()" call fails in priv_init(), blow up.

Version 0.8.2:
	Moved some debug output to syslog.
	Added proper namespaces for C++ classes to fix problems with
	newer g++ versions.
	Added priv_pam_fail_delay.
	Fixed some ordering issues in autogen.sh that let it work with a
	wider range of auto-tool versions.

Version 0.8.1:
	Improved some comments.
	Added config requirement for priv_runas.

Version 0.8:
	Added support for "priv_rerunas" and "priv_execve".  This should
	software that needs to do a uid transition at some midpoint and
	continue.  You'll still have to hack your software some, as
	priv_rerunas falls out of priv_init a second time, but I found
	that this functionality handled FTPD.

Version 0.5:
	Initial release.  Handles file open, bind, and various PAM functions
	in addition to fork and daemon.  Sufficient to port httpd, but not
	sufficient for FTPD or other authenticating servers.
