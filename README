PRIVMAN:  A simple privilege separation library.

To build:
	./configure
	make
	make install

It should compile cleanly, modulo a couple of warnings from the YACC template
code.  If it fails, please let us know.

The directories here are:

clients		Applications that have been adapted for privilege management
		(i.e., clients of the PRIVMAN server).

docs		Papers, documentation.

etc		Sample configuration files for managed servers.  Used for
		the tests.

man		Man pages for the various PRIVMAN library calls.

src		The source to the PRIVMAN library/server.

tests		Simple test programs to demonstrate the use of the library,
		and to test the functionality.


Platform notes:

Solaris:
	For some reason, apparently involving shared libraries and C++
constructors, Privman doesn't work as a shared library on the version of
Solaris I was able to test on.  Use "./configure --disable-shared".  Also
the "check_user" test won't build since Solaris's PAM implementation
does not provide the misc_conv utility function to ask for passwords.

OS X:
	Similar to solaris, I had problems getting shared libraries to
work.  The symptom is the program hanging when it attempts to run the
first method from the shared library.
